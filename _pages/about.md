Welcome! 

I am a broadly trained geography student with specialization in spatial technologies and data-driven modeling techniques. I am generally interested in sustainable land use with particular emphasis on rural livelihoods, nature-based solutions, decision-making for conservation practices and climate adaptation, and developing effective decision support tools.

I explore questions such as:

- What are the benifits of ecosystems and how people perceive and manage natural resources?

- What are the spatial flow paths and dynamics of ecosystem services?

- What are the values of nature-based solutions to global challenges?

- What practices and policies would work to make production more sustainable and where to start, how, by who and when?
