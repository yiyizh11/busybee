Welcome! 

I am a broadly trained geography student who draws from multiple disciplinary perspectives and applies spatial technologies and data-driven modeling techniques to the study of sustainability. I pursue my interests in rural livelihoods, social-ecological interactions, climate vulnerability and adaptation across multiple scales and decision-making settings (e.g. household livelihood strategies, land management decisions). 

Recognizing uneven distributions of resources, varying ecosystem services benefits across communities, and sustainable land use challenges associated with trade-offs, I am motivated to make a small contribution to our understanding of ecosystem service flows and land management practices. My current research focus is on developing models that can capture spatio-temporal dependencies of ecosystem service flows across complex Canadian landscapes.
