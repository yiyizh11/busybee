Welcome! 

I am broadly trained in geography and draw from multiple disciplinary perspectives and applies spatial technologies and data-driven modeling techniques to the study of sustainability. I pursue my interests in rural livelihoods, social-ecological interactions, climate vulnerability and adaptation across multiple scales and decision-making settings (e.g. household livelihood strategies, land management decisions, restoration prioritization). 

Recognizing uneven distributions of resources, varying ecosystem services across communities, and sustainable land use challenges associated with trade-offs, I am motivated to make a small contribution to our understanding of ecosystem service flows and the implications of land management decisions, especially in agricultural systems. My current research focus is on understanding beneficial management practice adoption and benefits at the landscape level.
