Welcome! 

I am a broadly trained geography student who draws from multiple disciplinary perspectives and applies spatial technologies and data-driven modeling techniques to the study of sustainability. I pursue my interests in rural livelihoods, social-ecological interactions, climate adaptation across multiple scales and decision-making settings (e.g. household livelihood strategies, land management decisions). My current research focus is on developing models that can capture important aspects of distant interactions and the associated impacts on human well-being.
