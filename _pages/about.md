Welcome! 

I am a broadly trained geography student with specialization in spatial technologies and data-driven modeling techniques. I am generally interested in sustainable land use with particular emphasis on ecosystem service dependency, cultural landscape dynamics, nature-based solutions to global challenges, and decision-making for conservation practices and climate adaptation.

I explore questions such as:

- What are the benifits of ecosystems and how people perceive and manage natural resources?
- What are the ecosystem-related shifts in customer preferences and how they impact damand for key products and services?
- What practices and policies would work to make production more sustainable and where to start, how, by who and when?
